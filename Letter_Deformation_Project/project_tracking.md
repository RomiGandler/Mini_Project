**Project Tracking & Documentation** 

I have modified it to reflect the **recent refactoring** (moving to `Run_Project`), the switch to **JSON configuration**, the new **ML dataset generator**, and the unified **Main Pipeline**.

# 📂 Project Documentation & Tracking

## 🗂 File Dictionary

*A guide to the current codebase structure.*

### Core Modules (`src/`)

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **`letter_model.py`** | **The Engine.** Handles canvas creation, low-level OpenCV drawing, and applying morphological transformations. |
| **`base_letters.py`** | **The Blueprint.** Contains logic for drawing specific letters (A, B, C, F, X, W). Calculates geometry and applies trigonometry for deformations. |
| **`param_config.json`** | **The Rulebook.** A centralized JSON file defining the Min/Max/Default values for every parameter to ensure consistency across all tools. |

### Executable Tools (`Run_Project/` & Root)

| File | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`main.py`** | **Controller** | The master script (CLI) that manages the entire pipeline and allows running all tools from one menu. |
| **`interactive_game.py`** | **GUI Tool** | A Matplotlib-based GUI with sliders to manually "feel" the parameter changes in real-time. |
| **`analyze_parameter.py`** | **Analysis** | Generates **1D Distance Graphs**. Visualizes how a single parameter (e.g., Shear) affects the SSIM score. |
| **`analyze_heatmap.py`** | **Analysis** | Generates **2D Heatmaps**. Visualizes the correlation between *two* parameters simultaneously. |
| **`inter_letter_analysis.py`** | **Analysis** | Generates a **Similarity Matrix**. Compares the base versions of all letters against each other to check for inherent similarities. |
| **`generate_dataset.py`** | **Data Gen** | Mass-produces thousands of deformed letter images (with metadata) for Machine Learning training. |

## 🚀 Development Milestones

*A log of the steps taken to build the project.*

### Phase 1: Infrastructure ✅

* [x] **Basic Skeleton:** Created `LetterSkeleton` for canvas handling.
* [x] **Distance Metric:** Integrated `SSIM` (Structural Similarity) to objectively measure image deformation.

### Phase 2: Letter Definitions ✅

* [x] **Basic Set (A, B, C):** Implemented logic for basic geometric letters.
* [x] **Extended Set (F, X, W):** Added complex letters requiring multi-line logic.
* [x] **Refactoring:** Converted hardcoded values into dynamic variables.

### Phase 3: Robustness & Safety ✅

* [x] **Geometric Constraints:** Added "Clamping" logic to prevent drawing errors (e.g., keeping A's legs inside the frame).
* [x] **Central Configuration:** Migrated from Python dictionaries to `param_config.json` for easier external editing.

### Phase 4: Advanced Visualization & Analysis ✅

* [x] **Interactive Tool:** Built the slider-based GUI.
* [x] **Heatmaps:** Implemented 2D matrix visualization (Seaborn).
* [x] **Parameter Sweeps:** Created logic to graph distance vs. parameter intensity.
* [x] **Inter-Letter Matrix:** Added logic to compare different letters (e.g., How similar is A to X?).

### Phase 5: Pipeline & Production ✅

* [x] **Dataset Generator:** Created a script to export images + JSON labels for ML.
* [x] **Unified CLI:** Built `main.py` to orchestrate all scripts via a terminal menu.
* [x] **Project Cleanup:** Organized files into `src`, `Run_Project`, and `analysis`.

## 📝 Next Steps / Future Work

* [ ] **Final Report:** Compile all generated graphs into a PDF report.
* [ ] **Machine Learning:** Use the dataset generated by `generate_dataset.py` to train a Neural Network to recognize deformed letters.
* [ ] **Perceptual Breakpoints:** Analyze the 1D graphs to find the exact parameter value where a letter becomes "unrecognizable" (SSIM > 0.5).

## 🧠 Key Research Findings

*Insights derived from the `analysis/` output folder.*

### 1. Letter A: Shear vs. Width (Heatmap Analysis)

Based on `heatmap_A_shear_x_base_width_factor.png`:

* **The "Sweet Spot":** The lowest distance scores (0.10 - 0.12) occur when Shear is near 0 and Width is standard (1.0).
* **Dominant Factor:** Width is more critical than Shear. Extreme broadening (>1.5) ruins the SSIM score faster than extreme shearing.

### 2. Letter B: Structural Complexity

* **Findings:** Letter B is highly sensitive to `vertical_squash`. Because it relies on two loops, squashing it vertically causes the loops to merge or distort significantly faster than open letters like 'C'.

### 3. Inter-Letter Similarity

* **Findings:** The `inter_letter_analysis.py` matrix reveals that 'X' and 'W' have the highest inherent similarity due to their diagonal stroke composition, while 'B' is the most unique structurally due to its enclosed loops.
